                            <p>A health insurance policy ideally covers 4 categories as mentioned below:</p>
                            <p>a) In-patient Treatment - Hospitalisation expenses incurred for room rent, boarding expenses,
                                nursing, intensive care unit, medical practitioner, medicines and other related expenses
                                due to an illness or accident.</p>
                            <p>b) Pre-Hospitalisation- Expenses incurred due to an illness before hospitalisation</p>
                            <p>c) Post-Hospitalisation- Expenses incurred after discharge from hospitalisation</p>
                            <p>d) Day care procedures- Treatments which do not require 24 hours hospitalisation</p>

                            <p>
                                Illness is unforeseen, and cannot be predicted so Health Insurance comes to your rescue and finances your medical expenses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover the Healthcare expenditure in our country is expensive and so Health Insurance helps in financing the medical emergency.
                            </p>

                                <div class="accord-title">3. What are the important things to check in the policy?</div>
                                <i class="pull-right fa " ng-class="{'fa fa-chevron-down': status.open3, 'fa fa-chevron-right': !status.open3}"></i>

                            <p>a) Understand whether the product features/benefits meets not only just your current requirements
                                but also future eventualities.</p>
                            <p>b) Know the waiting period for pre-existing diseases, usually an insurance company covers the
                                expenses on pre-existing diseases after a period of 4 years.</p>
                            <p>c) Verify if there is a clause of co-payment (means that the policyholder has to bear some percentage
                                of expense of the claim). The co-pay clause is usually a feature in senior citizen health
                                insurance policies. </p>
                            <p>d) Check the exclusions in the policy. This is important as one should be aware of the limitations
                                in the policy to avoid chaos at the time of a claim.</p>
                            <p>e) Check the Proposal form filled &amp; declarations submitted if they have been recorded correctly
                                &amp; completely.</p>

                            <p>Yes, cashless facility is an inherent part of all health insurance policies. You donâ€™t have to
                                ask or pay any additional amount for the same.</p>

                                benefits. A standard policy would have 3 types of waiting periods:-</p>
                            <p>In the first year of the policy, there would be a waiting period of 30 days for claims related
                                to sickness.</p>
                            <p>Any existing ailment for which treatment or any medication is taken would be excluded for minimum
                                period of 4 years. If there are no ailments declared/detected, then there is no waiting period.</p>

                            <p>Family Floater is a policy which covers more than one family member for a fixed cover. Here the
                                fixed cover is shared by all the family members, i.e. if Shah Family of four take a cover
                                of 5 lakhs, the entire family can share the sum insured of Rs. 5 Lakhs during the term of
                                the policy. So, if Mrs. Shah makes a hospitalization claim of Rs. 75000/-, the remaining
                                4.25 Lakhs can be claimed by the four members in the course of the year.</p>
